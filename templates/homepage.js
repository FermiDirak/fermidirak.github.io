      <h3>Profesional Full Stack Developer | Product Architect</h3>

      <br/>

      <p>
        I'm a full stack engineer who likes to build things and build things well.
        I have three apps with over 5000 downloads published to the google play store,
        have lead the development of a core embedded machine learning library at a
        start-up, and have extensive knowledge over the front-end ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve given presentations on topics ranging from the fundamentals of machine
        learning to a how-to on remixing songs with turntables. I’m also a regular
        publisher of online media, from technical articles on Medium to electronic music
        on Soundcloud.
